# ðŸ’° $alary $leuth ðŸ’°
This is a Python program that checks the median salaries of software engineers for companies that have a job posting with a certain keyword in their job description. It uses the [go-dork](https://github.com/dwisiswant0/go-dork) command line tool (shoutout to [dwisiswant0](https://github.com/dwisiswant0)) to search for job postings, and the levels.fyi website to retrieve salary information for a given company.

## Usage
```bash
python salarysleuth.py [-j | --job job_characteristic] [-c | --company companyname] [-p | --pages pages] [-e | --engine engine] [-t --table] [-h | --help]
```

## Options
* `-j job_characteristic`, `--job job_characteristic` - Job characteristic to search for on job listing websites
* `-c company`, `--company company` - Name of a specific company to search for salary information
* `-p pages`, `--pages pages` - Optional: Number of pages you'd like to dork (default: 50)
* `-e engine`, `--engine engine` - Optional: The search engine you'd like to use (default: google) Options: Google, Shodan, Bing, Duck, Yahoo, Ask 
* `-t`, `--table` - Optional: Re-organize output into a table in ascending order based on median salary (default: false)
* `-r`, `--remote` - Optional: Retrieve only remote jobs
* `-h`, `--help` - Optional. Displays the help menu.

```

- Search 40 Google pages for jobs that contain "OSCP", returning data regardless of if median salary exists on levels[.]fyi:
```bash
python salarysleuth.py -j "OSCP" -p 40 
```
