This is a Go program that checks the median salaries of software engineers for companies that have a job posting with a certain keyword in their job description. It searches LinkedIn for job postings and the levels.fyi website to retrieve salary information for a given company.

## Usage

salarysleuth [-d | --description job_characteristic] [-l | --location location] [-t | --title title_keyword] [-r | --remote] [--internships] [-s | --silence] [-h | --help]
```

## Options
* `-d job_characteristic`, `--description job_characteristic` - Job characteristic or keyword to search for in the job description on LinkedIn
* `-l location`, `--location location` - City name to search for jobs on LinkedIn, or 'United States' for nationwide search (default: "United States")
* `-t title_keyword`, `--title title_keyword` - Optional: Keyword to search for in job titles on LinkedIn
* `-r`, `--remote` - Optional: Retrieve only remote jobs or jobs listed under "United States"
* `--internships` - Optional: Retrieve only jobs with "intern" in the title
* `-s`, `--silence` - Optional: Silence the banner
* `-h`, `--help` - Optional. Displays the help menu.

## Examples

```

- Search only for internships that include "Software Engineer" in the title:
```bash
